# Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge 🕹️

## A simple game made with REACT

This [tutorial](https://fr.react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) is guiding me through some core React concepts, like building components, managing state, and passing data via props—all while creating a fun, interactive game!

It was made during my Web Dev bootcamp at Becode in Septembre 2024

🎯 My Goals with this project:

	•	Understand Components: Break the game into reusable parts (like squares and the board) and build them as components.
	•	Master State Management: Learn how to manage game logic (like tracking turns) with useState.
	•	Handle Props: Pass important data between components to keep everything in sync.

🧠 What I’m Learning:

	•	Building Components: I’m constructing the UI by making reusable React components, starting with squares and grouping them into a board.
	•	State Management: I’m using useState to handle which player’s turn it is and what moves have been made.
	•	Props: By passing props, I’m ensuring that each square knows when to display an “X” or “O” when clicked.

🚀 Next Steps:

	•	Complete the game logic to declare a winner and reset the board for a new game.
	•	Display which player’s turn it is and keep track of the game’s history.

I’m following along with the official React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, which has been super helpful. Each step is making me feel more confident in my React skills! 😄
